* Formatting and Org-Mode Document as a PDF

  You can produce an attractive PDF version of any =org-mode= document
  by loading the =.org= file into Emacs and using the command
  =C-c C-e l p=, which will:
  1. Export the =org= file as a \LaTeX{} document
  2. Format the document using the \LaTeX{} processor
  3. Display the resulting PDF

  Please don't commit \LaTeX{} or PDF documents to the repository;
  only =org-mode= "source" document should be under revision control.
  The other files can be created easily on demand.
